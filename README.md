This is a project where we were instructed to write article on the above topic. The article covers the following:
* Address typing on a web browser tab(OS abstraction)
* Address Resolution Protocol(ARP) using Domain Name Server(DNS)
* HTTP/HTTPS
* TCP/IP
* TLS/SSL
* Load Balancer(HAProxy)
* LAMP stack

You can read the overly summarized article(due to character restriction) on my LinkedIn [here]

Also you can view the schematic diagram with detailed explanation [here]
